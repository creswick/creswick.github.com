Over the past year, the people I know well have become quite scattered across the nation, if not the globe. As a result, I'm left wanting to keep up to date with friends in Southern California, Oregon, New York, Boston, Nebraska, Britain (for a while), Seattle, and at the moment, a body of water in southwest-ish Alaska. I'm sure there are others, but you people are hard to keep tabs on!

This has led me to try blogging -- somehow there's a connection there that makes sense, but I doubt I can explain it modestly. Because of that, I'm going to claim this is a personal record for my own use.

And with that,

Good night!
