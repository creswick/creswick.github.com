I'm done with firefox -- Opera 10 now plays flash well, has adblock via. urifilters, a cleaner UI (no menubar, a menu *button*!) vertical tabs are supported natively, etc... I don't really like the widget toolkit used in the file open/save dialog, but that's *much* better than the horrid performance/stability/bizarre bugs of Firefox.

The minimal UI possible with Opera is also a major win in my book.
