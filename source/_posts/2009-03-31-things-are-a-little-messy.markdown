title: Things are a little messy...

I've had some minor upgrade issues with the blog lately, and I am only about halfway through updating everything.  In the meantime, I'm afraid things will look a bit messy.  (Syntax highlighting is currently broken, and there are probably other formatting / data issues as well.  I think I have to restore the uploads directory, for one, so there probably won't be any images in the posts for a while.)
