I'm a sucker for pretty desktops and window managers.  This weakness has yet to make me succumb to the lure of a full Gnome (or KDE) desktop, however.  (Although I did play with the <strike>hack</strike> kludge known as <em>XGL/compiz</em> for a month or so.) I alternate between <a title="Enlightenment" href="http://www4.get-e.org/">Enlightenment</a> and <a title="FVWM" href="http://fvwm.org">FVWM</a>, however, I do use a fair number of GTK apps.  Eventually, I hope to create some gtk apps, (or wxWidgets, or etc... it all boils down to gtk showing up on screen though).  Up 'till now I've suffered through with the dreadfull defaults -- in my opinion, of course -- but that just changed with <a title="gtk-theme-switch2" href="http://www.muhri.net/nav.php3?node=gts">gtk-theme-switch2</a>.

It is awesome :) theme loading, previewing, setting, etc.. all without a hint of the gnome infrastructure to screw your keyboard layout, fonts, or power management.
