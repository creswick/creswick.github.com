title: The US in Pictures

I've posted photos from my drive across the US this spring, along with a host of other shots that I've been meaning to share for ages. I realized the other day that when driving through the midwest, despite being in awe of the scenery, and miles upon miles of picturesque fields, I never took any pictures. I do believe I was waiting for a high point to take them from, to get a full sweeping view of the surrounding area, but alas, I was in the Midwest.
