title: Blogging with emacs + mt.el
categories: tech
---
<p>I've wanted to use emacs as a blogging tool for a long time, but I've
always run into issues.  Today I ran across a blog post that describes
an approach that works:</p>

 <p>http://ektich.wordpress.com/2006/01/30/how-to-blog-from-emacs/</p>

<p>In addition to the instructions there, I had to pull down:</p>

<p><li>elib (with apt)</li>
<li>xml.el (from: http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~rhl/skyserver/xml.el)</li></p>

<p>Ping me with questions -- more details soon to come as I play with
mt.el, and possibly weblogger.el (which looks nicer, on first
impressions.)</p>
