title: It's called a docking station, Joel :)

The venerable Joel Spolsky asked recently why [someone hasn't made a device][1] that clips to the back of a desk and:

<blockquote>
    * It's a power strip<br>
    * It's a network hub<br>
    * It's a USB hub<br>
    * You clamp it onto the back of any desk
</blockquote>

The idea being that: 

<blockquote>This would make it easy to plug in laptops, USB peripherals, and all your rechargers at your desk without crawling around on the floor.</blockquote>

He links to a device that does some of this, and runs ~$150/device.  At that price, I think a better solution is a docking station--when you get down to it, I don't want to plug in 4 things every time I sit down even if it doesn't involve crawling under the desk (power, video, usb, ethernet and possibly audio).  I think it's unlikely that all the features needed above are really necessary when you just show up for a meeting, or hop over to your coworker's office for a short hacking session.  Many conference rooms these days already have tables wired for ethernet / power and svga video to a projector.
