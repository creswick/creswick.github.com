    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I realized today that Fedora 15 doesn't expose a UI for selecting
another xsession by default -- you can only log into Gnome 3.
Thankfully, once you install another window manager, then the
selection widget does appear; however, it was not clear how to add a
WM that wasn't packaged with Fedora.</p>

<p>In my case, I wanted to run the latest development version of
<a href="http://xmonad.org">xmonad</a>.  (Queue about an hour of fruitless
Googling.)</p>

<p>Eventually, I broke down and <code>yum install fluxbox</code>'d to get an
example.  After that, a <code>repoquery --list fluxbox</code> gave a list of the
files installed, and pointed me to <code>/usr/share/xsessions</code>, which
contains the list of WMs that the Fedora greeter uses to present
options.</p>

<p>Adding a new option is as simple as creating a new desktop file in
that directory, and pointing the <code>Exec</code> field to the binary of your
WM.</p>

<p>eg:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ cd /usr/share/xsessions/
$ cat xmonad.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Name=XMonad
Comment=Tiling window manager
Exec=/home/creswick/development/xmonad/cabal-dev/bin/xmonad
Type=Application
